# Hackathon-Project-Store
Hackathon project to create a store for the data structures class. Made by: Francisco Martell, Michael A Gonzales, and Kyle Kunkel

Note: The Master Store Project zip folder contains a hashmap class for the item inventory. It wasn't able to be fully integrated and has a few bugs for the print function but is a good start.
